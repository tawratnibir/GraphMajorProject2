=== Building Graph for Problem 2 ===
Parsed 49869 road segments from CSV
Built road graph with 46669 nodes and 53878 edges
Parsed 14 metro segments from CSV
Added 14 metro edges to graph

Done! You can now:
  - View route_output.txt for turn-by-turn directions
  - Open route.kml in Google Earth or Google MyMaps
  - Red lines = Car segments, Green lines = Metro segments
